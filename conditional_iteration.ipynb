    "For this problem set, we will use data from the file `ca-GrQc.txt`, which you can locate in the `data` repository. The file contains the co-authorship links for articles in the ArXiv category General Relativity. Each line in the file includes the ids of two authors who have worked together on at least one article. In network analysis parlance, this is known as an \"edge list.\" The data are obtained from the [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) and you can find more information about them on https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.html.\n",

However, if you don't manage to obtain these objects at the beginning, just hard-code fictitious ones, e.g. `[13, 14, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 45]` or `{13: [13, 7596, 11196, 19170], 14: [14171]}`.

Your list should look like `[[3466, 937], [3466, 5233], ...]`. To achieve this, use a `for` loop to iterate over each line in the file. One way to do this is as follows:\n",
